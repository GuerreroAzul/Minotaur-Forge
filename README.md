# PlayOnLinux Script

![PlayOnLinux](https://img.shields.io/badge/PlayOnLinux-4.3.4-green)

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to develop a series of custom scripts for PlayOnLinux, a tool that allows the installation and management of applications and games designed for Windows on Linux operating systems. PlayOnLinux provides a friendly graphical interface that simplifies the use of Wine, the underlying compatibility layer that makes it possible to run Windows programs in Linux environments.

In this project, the advanced capabilities of PlayOnLinux are explored by creating scripts that automate and optimize software installation, improving the user experience. These scripts will allow users to install and configure applications more efficiently, addressing common issues such as dependency configuration, version management, and applying specific patches.

The implementation of these scripts is intended not only to simplify the lives of end users, but also to contribute to the PlayOnLinux community with reusable and customized solutions.

## Basic knowledge

### What is wine?

Wine is a compatibility layer that allows Windows applications to run on operating systems such as Linux, macOS, BSD, and Solaris.

Wine translates Windows API calls into POSIX calls in real time, allowing Windows applications to be integrated into the desktop without memory and performance penalties.

Wine also offers a set of development tools to port Windows application source code to Unix.

### What is PlayOnLinux?

PlayOnLinux is a free and open source program that allows you to run Windows applications on Linux. To do this, it uses scripts that modify the behavior of Wine, a program that already exists.

Some of the features of PlayOnLinux are:
- You do not need to have a Windows license to use it.
- Programs are installed in different containers to prevent them from interfering with each other.
- Users can create their own scripts, with a "**.sh**" extension.
- If a game is not in the script database, it can be installed manually.
